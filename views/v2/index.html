    <p>This Prototype was created in response to the user labs that ran in November 2017.</p>
    <p>This prototype reduces the pages and content on the landing page. It alters the page names and content to better reflect the user behaviour seen in lab 6</p>
    <p>
      The prototype also adds:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Back to top button on landing page
      </li>

          In lab 6, users found navigating between pages easier but were unsure which page contained the information they wished to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we update the page headers to reflect the subjects in the users' own voice <br />
          <strong>then</strong> we will improve navigation <br />
          <strong>because</strong> users will easily be able to find further information that is relevant to them
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In lab 6, users didn't use the bottom of the page pagination links. Some users on UserZoom used them extensively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we increase the size of the next/prev label and reduce the page title slightly <br />
          <strong>then</strong> users will better understand how to cycle through pages <br />
          <strong>because</strong> users will immediately understand the concept that the bottom of the page link takes them to the next page/topic.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In lab 6, users immediately scrolled past the blue banner to explore content, even when tasked with finding other pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we change the blue box link header to a non-coloured box<br />
          <strong>then</strong> users will be better able to navigate between pages<br />
          <strong>because</strong> it will be easier to read the links and users won't think that it is just a graphical element<br />
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In lab 6, one user clicked a link but turned their head. When they looked back they didn't see the page load and thought the page had failed to change state
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we change the blue box link header to a non-coloured box<br />
          <strong>then</strong> users will notice the change between pages<br />
          <strong>because</strong> the page change will be indicated by link colour and state change, compared to just text-decoration change<br />
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In lab 6, users didn't understand the scope of the service after interacting with the landing page
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we summarise content a user needs to understand on the landing page<br />
          <strong>then</strong> users will understand the service better<br />
          <strong>because</strong> they will be able to scan the homepage and capture the main features of the service<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we display the summary content in a visually appealing way<br />
          <strong>then</strong> users will understand the service better<br />
          <strong>because</strong> as studies show, they will be spend more time engaging with the content directly related to it<br />
