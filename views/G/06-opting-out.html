              <p>You have the right to opt-out of sharing your personally identifiable data. This will mean your identifiable details, like your name and address, will no longer appear in data shared by NHS Digital.</p>
              <p>This will only happen if opt-outs apply to the data set being shared. There are some circumstances where opt-outs do not apply and your personally identifiable data will be used. This includes anytime you visit a health or social care professional for your own individual care purposes.</p>

        <p>The record of information received allows NHS Digital to check the date an opt-out was received. It also shows if an opt-out decision has been withdrawn. This tells us when we are able to share personally identifiable data and when we need to apply an opt-out preference.</p>
        <p>The record of current opt-outs is used as part of an IT system. This applies an opt-out decision to data before it is shared outside of NHS Digital.</p>
        <p>Once an opt-out request is received, it can take up to 21 days before it can be applied to future data releases. Once applied, an opt-out will continue to be upheld following a patient's death.</p>

        <h2 id="where-opts-out-do-bot-apply">Where opt-outs do not apply</h2>
        <p>This opt-out will not apply in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where the information is used for purposes relating to your individual care</li>
          <li>Where the personal confidential information held by NHS Digital does not contain an NHS number</li>
          <li>If you have given consent for your data to be used for a specific reason, like a medical research study</li>
          <li>If the information is not classed as personal confidential information. This is a combination of data that identifies who you are and information on your health, care or treatment. Personal confidential information is defined in the NHS Act 2006, Section 251, paragraphs 10 and 11</li>
          <li>Where anonymised data means individuals are not identifiable from the information</li>
          <li>Where there is a legal requirement to provide information, such as an order of court</li>
          <li>Where there is an overriding public interest in the disclosure of your data</li>
          <li>Where information is used to support the management of communicable diseases and other risks to public health. This comes under Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002</li>
          <li>Where birth and cancer information is supplied to the Office for National Statistics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="other-services">Other services</h2>
        <p>This opt-out will not apply where information is provided for the Assuring Transformation (AT) collection of data about people with learning disabilities and/or autism, who are in hospital for mental or behavioural healthcare reasons.</p>
        <p>This opt-out will also not apply where information is provided to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.ncras.nhs.uk/removal-request/" target="_blank" title="National Cancer Registration Service Opt-out - NCRAS" >National Cancer Registration Service</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>If you do not want to share your information for any of these purposes, you must opt-out of them separately.</p>
        <p>If you have previously given consent to share your data for another specific reason or research study, and no longer wish for your data to be used in this way, you should contact the organisation you gave consent to.</p>
